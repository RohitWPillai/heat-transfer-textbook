## Introduction

Now we combine view factors with surface properties to calculate actual heat transfer between surfaces.

## Exchange Between Blackbodies

For two blackbody surfaces:

$$q_{1 \to 2} = A_1 F_{1 \to 2} \sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4)$$

```{python}
sigma = 5.67e-8  # Stefan-Boltzmann constant

def radiation_exchange_blackbody(A1, F12, T1, T2):
    """Heat transfer between two blackbody surfaces."""
    return A1 * F12 * sigma * (T1**4 - T2**4)

# Example: Two parallel plates
A = 1.0      # Area (m²)
F12 = 0.6    # View factor
T1 = 500     # K
T2 = 300     # K

Q = radiation_exchange_blackbody(A, F12, T1, T2)
print(f"Heat transfer: {Q:.0f} W")
```

## Radiosity Method for Gray Surfaces

For surfaces that aren't blackbodies, we track **radiosity** $J$: the total radiation leaving a surface.

$$J_i = \varepsilon_i E_{b,i} + \rho_i G_i$$

where $G_i$ is the irradiation arriving at surface $i$.

### Two-Surface Enclosure

$$q_{12} = \frac{\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)}{\frac{1-\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_1 A_1} + \frac{1}{A_1 F_{12}} + \frac{1-\varepsilon_2}{\varepsilon_2 A_2}}$$

```{python}
def radiation_two_surfaces(T1, T2, eps1, eps2, A1, A2, F12):
    """Heat transfer between two gray surfaces in an enclosure."""
    R1 = (1 - eps1) / (eps1 * A1)       # Surface 1 resistance
    R12 = 1 / (A1 * F12)                 # Space resistance
    R2 = (1 - eps2) / (eps2 * A2)       # Surface 2 resistance

    R_total = R1 + R12 + R2
    return sigma * (T1**4 - T2**4) / R_total

# Example
Q = radiation_two_surfaces(T1=500, T2=300, eps1=0.8, eps2=0.6, A1=1, A2=1, F12=0.6)
print(f"Heat transfer (gray surfaces): {Q:.0f} W")
```

## Radiation Shields

A thin, low-emissivity shield between surfaces reduces heat transfer:

$$q_\text{with shield} = \frac{q_\text{no shield}}{N + 1}$$

for $N$ identical shields.

## Summary

::: {.callout-tip}
## Key Takeaways
- Blackbody exchange: $q = A_1 F_{12} \sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4)$
- Gray surfaces: use radiosity method with resistances
- Shields dramatically reduce radiation heat transfer

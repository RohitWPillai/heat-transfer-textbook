## Introduction

Real surfaces don't behave like perfect blackbodies. Their radiative properties depend on material, surface finish, wavelength, and direction.

## Absorptivity, Reflectivity, Transmissivity

For irradiation $G$ incident on a surface:

$$\alpha + \rho + \tau = 1$$

- $\alpha$: absorptivity (fraction absorbed)
- $\rho$: reflectivity (fraction reflected)
- $\tau$: transmissivity (fraction transmitted)

For **opaque** surfaces ($\tau = 0$):
$$\alpha + \rho = 1$$

## Emissivity

$$\varepsilon = \frac{E}{E_b}$$

| Surface | ε |
|---------|---:|
| Polished aluminium | 0.04 |
| Oxidised aluminium | 0.2 |
| Black paint | 0.95 |
| Human skin | 0.95 |
| Snow | 0.8 |

## Kirchhoff's Law

At thermal equilibrium and for a given wavelength and direction:

$$\varepsilon_\lambda = \alpha_\lambda$$

For **gray surfaces** (properties independent of wavelength):

$$\varepsilon = \alpha$$

## Spectral Properties

Properties can vary significantly with wavelength:

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example: selective surface (solar absorber)
wavelengths = np.linspace(0.1, 20, 500)

# Idealized selective surface: high α in solar range, low ε in IR
alpha = np.where(wavelengths < 3, 0.95, 0.1)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
plt.fill_between(wavelengths, alpha, alpha=0.3)
plt.plot(wavelengths, alpha, 'b-', linewidth=2)
plt.axvline(x=3, color='red', linestyle='--', label='Solar/IR boundary')
plt.xlabel('Wavelength (μm)')
plt.ylabel('Absorptivity α')
plt.title('Selective Surface for Solar Collection')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.ylim(0, 1.1)
plt.show()
```

## Directional Properties

Emissivity often varies with angle from normal:

$$\varepsilon(\theta) \neq \varepsilon(0)$$

Conductors: ε increases with angle
Non-conductors: ε relatively constant then drops near 90°

## Summary

::: {.callout-tip}
## Key Takeaways
- $\alpha + \rho + \tau = 1$ (energy conservation)
- Kirchhoff: $\varepsilon_\lambda = \alpha_\lambda$ at equilibrium
- Gray body: $\varepsilon = \alpha$ (wavelength independent)
- Properties depend on material, surface finish, wavelength, direction

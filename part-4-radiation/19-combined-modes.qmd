## Introduction

In most real situations, heat transfer occurs by multiple modes simultaneously. A hot surface loses heat by both convection and radiation.

## Radiation Heat Transfer Coefficient

To combine radiation with convection, we linearise:

$$h_r = \varepsilon \sigma (T_s + T_\infty)(T_s^2 + T_\infty^2)$$

Then:
$$q_\text{total} = (h_\text{conv} + h_r) A (T_s - T_\infty)$$

```{python}
import numpy as np

sigma = 5.67e-8

def radiation_coefficient(eps, Ts, Tinf):
    """Linearised radiation heat transfer coefficient."""
    return eps * sigma * (Ts + Tinf) * (Ts**2 + Tinf**2)

# Example
Ts = 400  # K
Tinf = 300  # K
eps = 0.9

h_rad = radiation_coefficient(eps, Ts, Tinf)
print(f"Radiation coefficient: h_r = {h_rad:.1f} W/m²·K")

# Compare with typical convection
h_conv = 10  # Natural convection
print(f"Convection coefficient: h_conv = {h_conv:.1f} W/m²·K")
print(f"Radiation is {h_rad/h_conv:.1f}× convection")
```

## When Is Radiation Important?

Radiation becomes significant when:
- Temperatures are high (T⁴ dependence)
- Convection is weak (natural convection, vacuum)
- Surfaces have high emissivity

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Tinf = 300  # K
eps = 0.9
h_conv = 10  # W/m²·K

Ts_range = np.linspace(310, 600, 100)
h_rad = radiation_coefficient(eps, Ts_range, Tinf)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(Ts_range - 273, h_rad, 'r-', linewidth=2, label='$h_r$ (radiation)')
plt.axhline(y=h_conv, color='b', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, label=f'$h_{{conv}}$ = {h_conv} W/m²·K')
plt.xlabel('Surface temperature (°C)')
plt.ylabel('Heat transfer coefficient (W/m²·K)')
plt.title('Radiation vs Convection Coefficient')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.show()
```

## Example: Thermos Flask

A thermos minimises all three modes:
- **Conduction**: Vacuum gap eliminates it
- **Convection**: Vacuum prevents fluid motion
- **Radiation**: Silvered surfaces (low ε) reduce exchange

```{python}
# Thermos analysis
T_hot = 373   # K (boiling water)
T_cold = 293  # K (room temperature)
eps = 0.05    # Silvered surface
A = 0.05      # m² inner surface

# Only radiation remains (vacuum)
Q_rad = eps * sigma * A * (T_hot**4 - T_cold**4)
print(f"Heat loss (silvered): {Q_rad:.2f} W")

# If surfaces were black
Q_black = sigma * A * (T_hot**4 - T_cold**4)
print(f"Heat loss (black): {Q_black:.2f} W")
print(f"Reduction factor: {Q_black/Q_rad:.0f}×")
```

## Summary

::: {.callout-tip}
## Key Takeaways
- Radiation and convection often occur together
- Linearised $h_r$ allows simple combination: $h_\text{total} = h_\text{conv} + h_r$
- Radiation dominates at high T, low convection, high ε
- Good insulation addresses all three modes

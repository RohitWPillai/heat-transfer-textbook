## Introduction

Conduction is heat transfer through a medium without bulk motion. At the molecular level, it's the transfer of kinetic energy from more energetic to less energetic particles.

## Fourier's Law

$$q'' = -k \frac{dT}{dx}$$

or in three dimensions:

$$\vec{q}'' = -k \nabla T$$

where $k$ is the **thermal conductivity** (W/m·K).

```{python}
# Thermal conductivities at ~300K
materials = {
    'Copper': 401,
    'Aluminium': 237,
    'Steel': 60,
    'Glass': 1.4,
    'Wood': 0.15,
    'Air': 0.026,
}

print("Thermal conductivity (W/m·K):")
for mat, k in materials.items():
    print(f"  {mat:12s}: {k:6.2f}")
```

## The Heat Diffusion Equation

Starting from energy conservation:

$$\rho c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = k \nabla^2 T + \dot{q}'''$$

where $\dot{q}'''$ is volumetric heat generation.

In 1D with constant properties and no generation:

$$\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}$$

where $\alpha = k/(\rho c_p)$ is the **thermal diffusivity**.

## Boundary Conditions

| Type | Name | Form |
|------|------|------|
| 1st | Dirichlet | $T = T_s$ (specified temperature) |
| 2nd | Neumann | $-k\frac{\partial T}{\partial n} = q''_s$ (specified flux) |
| 3rd | Robin | $-k\frac{\partial T}{\partial n} = h(T_s - T_\infty)$ (convection) |

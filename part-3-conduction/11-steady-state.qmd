- Handle composite walls and contact resistance

## Introduction

In steady state, temperatures don't change with time: $\partial T/\partial t = 0$. This simplifies analysis considerably.

## Plane Wall

For 1D steady conduction through a plane wall:

$$\frac{d^2 T}{dx^2} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad T(x) = C_1 x + C_2$$

Heat flux:
$$q'' = \frac{k(T_1 - T_2)}{L}$$

## Thermal Resistance

By analogy with electrical circuits:

$$q = \frac{\Delta T}{R}$$

For a plane wall:
$$R_\text{cond} = \frac{L}{kA}$$

For convection:
$$R_\text{conv} = \frac{1}{hA}$$

```{python}
def thermal_resistance_wall(L: float, k: float, A: float) -> float:
    """Thermal resistance of a plane wall."""
    return L / (k * A)

def thermal_resistance_conv(h: float, A: float) -> float:
    """Thermal resistance for convection."""
    return 1 / (h * A)

# Example: Wall with convection on both sides
L = 0.2       # Wall thickness (m)
k = 1.0       # Thermal conductivity (W/m·K)
A = 10        # Area (m²)
h_in = 10     # Inside h (W/m²·K)
h_out = 25    # Outside h (W/m²·K)

R_conv_in = thermal_resistance_conv(h_in, A)
R_wall = thermal_resistance_wall(L, k, A)
R_conv_out = thermal_resistance_conv(h_out, A)

R_total = R_conv_in + R_wall + R_conv_out
print(f"R_total = {R_total:.4f} K/W")
```

## Composite Walls

Resistances in series add:
$$R_\text{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \cdots$$

Resistances in parallel:
$$\frac{1}{R_\text{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \cdots$$

## Contact Resistance

At interfaces between materials:

$$R''_\text{contact} = \frac{1}{h_c}$$

Typical values: $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2}$ m²·K/W
